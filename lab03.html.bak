<h1> Html5 </h1>
<p>is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
It is the fifth and last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
 The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.
 It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).
 HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
 Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; 
 to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.
 without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
 HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, 
 and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.
 For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

<h3> History Html5 </h3>

<p> The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004.
 At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. 
 In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.
The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004,
 focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers,[12] including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. 
 The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.
 Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.
 The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5. The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.

WHATWG's Ian Hickson (Google) and David Hyatt (Apple) produced W3C's first public working draft of the specification on 22 January 2008

 <h1> CSS</h1>
 <p> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
 CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
 This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
 enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
 css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
 css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, 
in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

<h3> history CSS</h3>
<p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.
Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, 
and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)being released in 1996.
 In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.

Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.
 One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. 
 CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.

As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers.
 This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, 
 such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb, made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed.
 The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program.
 The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.
 Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.</p>
